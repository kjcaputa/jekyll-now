1. British keyboadr configuration
  In order to konfigure keyboard in british layout (with hash and tilda next to Enter) you should open terminal window and 
  
```shell
 $ setxkbmap -layout gb
```
If this does not help then execute this as well (Source: [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/434849/change-keyboard-layout-english-uk-on-command-line-to-english-us))
```shell
 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```
